Why is version/source control important?

These controls are integral for the software development process, increasing efficiency and reducing the number of opportunities for errors to occur. Version control systems track and display changes made by all users for an object stored within the systemâ€™s repository, and provide a history of that object as it proceeds through the development process. This control also may allow multiple users to work on the same code simultaneously, or may lock an object so that it may only be checked out by one user at a time. With these controls in place, the likelihood for errors to occur due to a developer modifying an outdated version of code is drastically reduced. Redundant work is able to be avoided as well, as users may view the history/changes to code being collaboratively developed and can see what has been accomplished by others.
